# Minigames!
Team: Bryant, Luna, & Liam\
Team Name: BryantLunaLiam\
# Project Description!
Our project consists of minigames that can be played by up to 8 people using a networking platform!\
The games are similar in style to WarioWare and Kahoot containing simple minigames that people play to rack-up points to decide a winner by the end!\
# Why we chose this project!
We chose this project because we thought it'd be fun to have the entire class involved in play testing the game. It was also in our range, coding minigames is simple and intuitive, and Luna's done network applications before.
# Project inspirations!
The inspiration for this project, as stated before, includes Kahoot and Warioware: quick, short, and fun minigame collections!
# Implementation!
This project will need an important network/server implementation that players can join in and play at the same time! We'll also need a sizeable amoount of minigames. I think aiming for around 6-8 minigames, each with variations would work great for this assignment.\
Luna will work on the networking, and Liam and Bryant will work on the minigames.
