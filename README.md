# Plants vs. Zombies: Java Edition!
Team: Bryant, Luna, & Liam
Team Name: BryantLunaLiam
## Project Description!
Our project consists of a demake (a remake developed on inferior infrastructure) of the popular game Plants Vs. Zombies. It will feature the tower defence elements of Plants Vz. Zombies, such as planting plants, managning sun production, and eliminating zombies.
## Why we chose this project!
We chose this project because we thought it'd be fun to think how the core features of Plants Vs. Zombies would work on Java! Also, I think Plants Vs. Zombies isn't far off from the projects we've done for this class in an internal level.
## Project inspirations!
The inspiration for this project, as stated before, is Plants Vs. Zombies!
## Implementation!
This project would utilize Java's class structures and extends feature; every game element would have its own class extending Kilt Graphics, and groups like Zombies and Plants will have a manager class to handle its tasks. We are aiming to complete at least one level with randomized Zombie positions and at least five different plants (Sunflower, Peashooter, Wallnut, Potato Mine, and Cherry Bomb). The tasks will be split amongst us.
